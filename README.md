Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Jamaddah and I am a React and PHP developer with a passion for building intuitive and user-friendly web applications.

I have a strong background in both front-end and back-end development, and have a particular affinity for the React framework. I have experience building and maintaining a variety of web applications, and am always looking to learn and improve my skills.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, collaborating with other developers on open-source projects, or spending time with my family and friends.

Feel free to take a look at my portfolio and reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges!
